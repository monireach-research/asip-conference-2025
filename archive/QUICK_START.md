## EMERGENCY ABSTRACT TEMPLATE (If Short on Time)

**Title**: Privacy-Preserving AI for Elderly Safety: A Technology Governance Approach to Affordable Healthcare Innovation in Developing Countries

**Structure** (250-300 words):

**Paragraph 1 - Problem (50 words)**:
"Aging populations in developing countries face critical safety challenges. Existing AI monitoring solutions raise privacy concerns (cloud data transmission) and accessibility barriers (high costs exclude middle-income households). This research addresses how technology governance principles can balance innovation, ethics, and accessibility."

**Paragraph 2 - Method (100 words)**:
"We developed a contactless incident detection system using edge computing (NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano) with 3× RGB cameras and privacy-by-design architecture (pose-only storage, immediate frame disposal). The system detects three evidence-based incident types: falls while standing/walking (37.7% of Thai elderly home accidents), falls from bed/chair (median 1.32 per facility in Chinese settings), and abnormal sit-to-stand transitions (pre-fall risk indicators). Privacy governance is achieved through 100% on-device processing, eliminating cloud transmission risks."

**Paragraph 3 - Results/Impact (100 words)**:
"At $540 total system cost, our solution is 58-71% cheaper than cloud alternatives ($1,350-$1,950/year), expanding market reach to 216,000-324,000 middle-income Cambodian elderly (12-18% of population). Technical targets include ≥95% detection accuracy and <1 second alert generation. This research provides a governance framework for privacy-preserving healthcare AI, demonstrating that ethical design and cost-effectiveness are complementary governance principles, not competing goals."

**Keywords**: Privacy-preserving AI, elderly safety monitoring, edge computing, technology governance, healthcare accessibility, developing countries, Cambodia

## DAILY 30-MINUTE PRACTICE ROUTINE

Use this EVERY DAY until conference:

**10 min**: Pick one topic, explain out loud, record it
- Day 1: System architecture
- Day 2: Privacy mechanisms
- Day 3: Cost-effectiveness
- Day 4: Three incident types
- Day 5: Why Cambodia
- Day 6: Edge vs cloud
- Day 7: Review weakest area

**5 min**: Write 3 sentences using 5 phrases from vocabulary banks

**10 min**: Answer 5 Q&A flashcards (30 seconds per answer)

**5 min**: Read one paragraph from a paper, explain it out loud, write 2-sentence summary

**Track**: Did you hesitate less than yesterday? Can you use technical terms naturally?

## PRESENTATION RESCUE: If You Freeze

Use this simple structure:

**Problem**: "Elderly people fall. Current solutions are expensive or invade privacy."

**Solution**: "We built an edge computing system with cameras that only stores skeletal poses, not faces."

**Impact**: "It costs $540 instead of $1,950 per year, making it affordable for middle-income families."

**Key Numbers**:
- 58-71% cheaper than cloud systems
- 216,000-324,000 potential users in Cambodia
- 95% detection accuracy target
- Zero cloud transmission = complete privacy

**Remember**: You know your research. You just need practice speaking about it.

## MINDSET RESET

**What you think**: "I can't write or present well."

**What's true**: Your Internal/External Validity writing shows you CAN explain concepts clearly. You just need:
1. Practice (30 min daily)
2. Structure (use templates provided)
3. Recording (to track improvement)

**Start small**: 10 minutes today. That's it.

**Tomorrow**: Another 10 minutes. You'll improve.

**By Week 2**: You'll notice you hesitate less.

**By Week 4**: Conference ready.

**The only way to fail is to not start. Start today with 10 minutes.**
