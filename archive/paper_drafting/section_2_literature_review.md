# Section 2: Literature Review

## 2.1 Elderly Safety Monitoring Technologies

The notion that wearable devices might serve as the primary solution for elderly fall detection is not without merit—indeed, fall detection watches and pendants have proliferated in recent years (one hesitates to say "recent" given the pace at which this field moves, though Chaudhuri et al.'s 2014 systematic review remains, somewhat ironically, among the most comprehensive examinations of the space). However, one must acknowledge what practitioners have known for some time: compliance challenges plague these systems with the sort of mundane persistence that rarely makes it into the polished abstracts of conference proceedings. Elderly users must remember to wear devices consistently, a requirement that proves particularly difficult at nighttime when fall risk paradoxically increases, and maintain battery charging—tasks that sound trivial until one confronts the reality that only 7.1% of wearable device projects monitored elderly in actual home environments, with most testing confined to controlled laboratory settings (Chaudhuri et al., 2014). The gap between lab performance and real-world deployment is, to put it mildly, not a new problem in assistive technology research.

Building on this foundation (or perhaps, more accurately, building around its limitations), cloud-based camera systems emerged as an alternative monitoring modality. These systems transmit video to third-party servers for processing—a design choice that neatly solves the computational problem while creating what can only be described as a rather substantial privacy concern (Upadhyay, 2025). The Kami Fall Detect Camera, for instance, requires continuous cloud connectivity and ongoing subscription payments, which presents accessibility barriers beyond the mere technical. Moreover, cameras face their own acceptance challenges, as elderly populations perceive video surveillance as intrusive (Uddin et al., 2018), a finding that perhaps should not surprise anyone who has actually considered what it might feel like to be monitored continuously in one's own home.

In light of these findings (both the technical and the somewhat obvious human factors), depth sensors—specifically RGB-D cameras employing 3D imaging—have been proposed as a privacy-preserving alternative. These systems eliminate facial recognition capability by design rather than by policy promise (Jalaleddini et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2020), which represents the sort of architectural enforcement that governance frameworks often discuss but rarely demonstrate. Nevertheless, sensor modality tradeoffs persist: privacy improvements come bundled with cost increases and performance constraints (Wang et al., 2020), a pattern that will become rather familiar as this review progresses.

Ambient sensors—motion detectors, passive infrared (PIR) sensors, door contact sensors—occupy yet another position in this technological landscape, one characterized by what might charitably be called "signal ambiguity." Falls and Activities of Daily Living produce similar sensor patterns (Uddin et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2020), which limits incident-specific detection capability in ways that render these systems more suitable for general activity monitoring than for the safety-critical application we consider here. Wang et al. (2020) report detection precision below 90% for individual sensor systems, though it bears noting that "precision" in this context often obscures as much as it reveals about real-world performance. Furthermore—and here Uddin et al. (2018) make an observation that deserves more attention than it typically receives—there exists a "lack of suitable outcomes to validate delivery of technological solutions for specific needs." That is to say, we have built systems without adequately defining what success looks like, which is (to engage in some perhaps inadvisable frankness) a persistent condition in applied AI research.

## 2.2 Privacy-Preserving AI Approaches

Having established the landscape of monitoring technologies, we turn to privacy-preserving computational approaches, though the term "privacy-preserving" itself warrants some scrutiny (a point to which we shall return, though likely not with the depth it merits given the constraints of this particular paper). Federated learning has emerged as something of a darling in the privacy literature—and not entirely without justification. The approach trains models across distributed data without sharing raw information (Yu et al., 2022), which represents genuine progress in privacy protection. However, federated learning still requires cloud infrastructure for coordination, along with the associated costs and, yes, some degree of network exposure that undermines the "complete privacy" claims one occasionally encounters in more breathless accounts of the technology.

Differential privacy offers another pathway, adding statistical noise to data to protect individual privacy while enabling analysis (Liu et al., 2023; Williamson & Prybutok, 2024). The technique is mathematically elegant—perhaps too elegant, given how infrequently the performance-accuracy tradeoffs receive adequate attention in healthcare AI contexts. Liu et al. (2023) document these challenges with admirable candor: noise injection reduces model accuracy, which poses rather obvious problems for safety-critical applications where missing a fall detection could prove fatal. The notion that one might fine-tune noise parameters to achieve optimal privacy-utility balance is theoretically sound but (and here we encounter one of those implementation gaps that separate academic papers from deployed systems) requires expertise and computational resources not readily available in resource-constrained healthcare contexts.

Edge computing, by contrast, sidesteps several of these complications through a fundamentally different architectural choice: processing data on local devices rather than transmitting to cloud servers. This provides what Burns (2024) terms "data locality benefits"—a phrase that, while perhaps less exciting than "federated learning" or "differential privacy," captures something essential: data never leaves the household. Chang et al. (2021) demonstrate that edge deployment eliminates cloud transmission and associated privacy concerns, though one must note (because the literature does not always make this sufficiently clear) that edge computing introduces its own constraints: local hardware limitations, update deployment challenges, and the rather mundane problem of who maintains these devices when they inevitably require troubleshooting.

Nevertheless—and here we arrive at what might be considered a central argument of this paper, though the point has been made before with varying degrees of impact—Cavoukian's Privacy by Design framework (Cavoukian et al., 2010) articulates principles that remain relevant despite (or perhaps because of) their age. The framework emphasizes embedding privacy into architecture from inception rather than retrofitting protections after system design, a distinction that maps rather directly onto the difference between edge computing (privacy by architecture) and differential privacy (privacy by mathematical intervention). Cavoukian identifies seven foundational principles, including "Privacy Embedded into Design" and "Proactive not Reactive," which sound almost obvious when stated plainly yet prove remarkably difficult to implement in practice—a gap between principle and practice that this paper seeks to address, at least in one specific context.

## 2.3 Technology Governance Frameworks

The proliferation of AI ethics guidelines in recent years has been, to put it diplomatically, vigorous. Almeida et al. (2020) synthesized 21 AI governance models into a unified framework emphasizing fairness, transparency, accountability, safety, and human rights—a list that has become something of a liturgy in the field, repeated with varying degrees of genuine commitment to implementation. The principles themselves warrant little debate; transparency, accountability, and fairness are difficult to argue against in the abstract. The challenge, as Birkstedt et al. (2023) observe with what one suspects is carefully modulated exasperation, lies in translating these ethical principles into organizational practice. They identify a need for what they term "Organizational AI Governance" (AIG), though the acronym risks adding to an already acronym-saturated field. More substantively, they note that implementation guidance remains limited—a finding that aligns distressingly well with this author's experience attempting to locate concrete operationalization strategies in the governance literature.

Data protection regulations represent another governance layer, though one characterized by uneven global implementation. GDPR, the General Data Protection Regulation that has become shorthand for "serious about privacy" in Western contexts, mandates privacy safeguards including data controllership, right to erasure, and data minimization (Williamson & Prybutok, 2024). These requirements pose particular challenges for blockchain and edge technologies (Williamson & Prybutok, 2024), though perhaps not insurmountable ones if system architects engage with regulatory requirements during design rather than treating compliance as a post-hoc constraint. However—and here we confront a regional specificity that matters for this paper's Cambodian focus—enforcement mechanisms remain limited in Southeast Asian contexts (Burns, 2024), which means that privacy protection cannot rely primarily on regulatory pressure but must instead be embedded in system architecture. This brings us back, somewhat inevitably, to Cavoukian's Privacy by Design, though one might wish for more recent work that addresses implementation in developing country contexts rather than continuing to cite a 2010 framework because the field has not adequately built upon it.

Healthcare privacy standards add yet another dimension to this regulatory landscape. Burns (2024) emphasizes that privacy and accountability principles prove essential for health security applications, a point that seems almost self-evident yet bears repeating given how frequently these principles receive lip service without substantive implementation. The author initially intended to discuss HIPAA (the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), that pillar of U.S. healthcare privacy law, but upon reflection (and fact-checking, which more papers should engage in before making sweeping claims about regulatory frameworks), HIPAA's applicability to Cambodian elderly monitoring systems proves rather limited. This highlights a broader challenge: healthcare privacy standards remain heavily Western-centric, with limited frameworks developed for or by developing countries.

Moving beyond privacy specifically, accessibility and digital inclusion policies address a different but equally critical governance dimension. Richardson et al. (2022) propose a Digital Determinants of Health framework operating across individual, interpersonal, community, and societal levels—a multi-level approach that captures the complexity of technology adoption barriers more adequately than single-factor explanations. Hatef et al. (2024) examine digital health equity frameworks, while Sylla et al. (2025) document persistent economic and infrastructure barriers to technology adoption in LMICs (low- and middle-income countries, for those not yet fluent in development acronyms). The cost barrier receives particular attention: when subscription-based monitoring systems require ongoing payments representing 5% or more of monthly household income, we have moved beyond "technology adoption challenges" into what might more accurately be termed "economic exclusion by design." This observation motivates the cost-effectiveness analysis presented later in this paper, though whether cost reduction alone proves sufficient to achieve meaningful accessibility remains an empirical question requiring longitudinal adoption studies that, unsurprisingly, have not yet been conducted.

## 2.4 Regional Context: Southeast Asian Elderly Care

Having situated this work within broader technology and governance literatures (perhaps at greater length than strictly necessary, though comprehensiveness has its virtues), we turn to regional context that shapes both the problem definition and solution constraints. Epidemiological evidence from Southeast Asia provides grounding for incident type prioritization—a design decision that might appear arbitrary without regional data but becomes defensible when anchored in local fall patterns. Maiyapakdee et al. (2025) report that 37.7% of elderly home accidents in Thailand are falls, a prevalence rate that justifies fall detection as a priority safety concern. Li and Shi (2022) examined 272 nursing facilities in China, identifying falls as the top adverse event, with bed and chair falls explicitly documented—a finding that informed this study's decision to prioritize falls from bed/chair as a distinct incident category rather than treating all falls as homogeneous. Romli et al. (2017) synthesize broader regional patterns, reporting fall prevalence of 7.5-10% in Thailand and Singapore, with ranges of 14-34% across Asia more broadly. The variation in these estimates reflects, one suspects, differences in measurement methodology as much as genuine geographic variation, though disentangling these factors would require a meta-analysis beyond this paper's scope.

Cultural norms regarding elderly care prove equally salient for system design, though discussing "culture" risks essentializing diverse populations—a trap this author hopes to avoid while still acknowledging meaningful patterns. Romli et al. (2017) document strong family caregiving norms rooted in filial piety values, with preference for home-based care over institutional facilities across Southeast Asian contexts. More specifically (and here the paper provides a direct quote worth preserving): "Older adults in ASEAN communities often live in extended family households with adult children providing supervision." This living arrangement shapes both the monitoring challenge (elderly are not isolated, but family members cannot provide 24/7 supervision) and potential solutions (systems must fit within family homes, not institutional settings). Technology adoption in these contexts cannot ignore social structures that differ substantially from the Western nuclear family model implicitly assumed in much assistive technology research.

Economic constraints represent the third critical dimension of regional context, one that perhaps receives less attention in technology-focused venues than it warrants. Cambodia's middle-income urban households—defined here as 4th and 5th quintile families earning $870-$1,622 per month according to Cambodia Socio-Economic Survey data (National Institute of Statistics, 2019)—face affordability thresholds that exclude many technologies developed for higher-income markets. When Sylla et al. (2025) discuss "persistent economic and infrastructure barriers" to technology adoption in LMICs, they describe not merely abstract "adoption challenges" but concrete financial constraints: a system costing several months' income proves inaccessible regardless of its technical sophistication or health benefits. Similarly, Hatef et al. (2024) document how cost barriers compound other Digital Determinants of Health, creating multilevel obstacles to digital health equity. This framing reframes cost not as a mere commercial consideration but as a governance dimension: if healthcare AI systems price out middle-income populations in developing countries, we have created governance structures (whether intentionally or through neglect) that exclude the majority of the global elderly population from technological safety benefits.

Taken together, these regional factors—epidemiological evidence, cultural caregiving norms, and economic constraints—inform the system design described in subsequent sections. Whether the synthesis of these considerations produces a system that actually works in Cambodian homes remains, as the Methodology section will make clear, incompletely validated at this stage. But the design choices emerge from regional context rather than imposing Western technological solutions onto different social and economic realities, which represents at minimum a different starting point than one often encounters in healthcare AI applications that discover "adoption barriers" only after deployment.
