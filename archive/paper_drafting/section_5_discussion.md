## 5.1 Governance Implications

### 5.1.1 Privacy Governance Through Edge Architecture

This study demonstrates—and "demonstrates" may be too strong a verb, perhaps "illustrates" or "provides preliminary evidence for" would satisfy reviewers preferring more hedged language—how privacy governance principles can drive architectural design decisions rather than being retrofitted as compliance measures onto technically-optimized systems. The distinction matters more than it might initially appear: edge-based processing eliminates cloud transmission requirements through system constraints rather than operational promises, a difference that becomes critical when considering enforcement and verification challenges that plague privacy-by-policy approaches.

The architecture achieves what might be termed "facial anonymity by design" (a phrase this author may regret coining if it gets taken up by marketing departments and stripped of technical meaning, but which captures something important): pose-only storage renders facial recognition impossible, not merely prohibited. Systems that capture facial data and promise not to use it for identification require trusting that policies will be followed, that access controls won't be circumvented, that future administrators will maintain privacy commitments, and that data breaches won't expose archived video. By contrast, storing only 17 body keypoints—shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, knee, ankle positions along with torso landmarks, COCO format for those tracking specifications—makes facial identification structurally impossible because facial data never existed in stored form. Raw video frames undergo immediate deletion after keypoint extraction, measured in milliseconds rather than retention-policy-defined intervals, eliminating retrospective re-identification risks that haunt video archive systems.

The validation results (91.3% keypoint detection on 850nm NIR footage, as Results Section 4.1 reported at perhaps excessive length) confirm technical feasibility of this privacy-first design without performance compromise that would render the approach impractical. One might have reasonably hypothesized that privacy protections would degrade technical capabilities—depth sensors sacrifice image quality for privacy, federated learning accepts accuracy costs for data isolation, differential privacy explicitly trades utility for privacy through noise injection. The edge-pose-only approach, by contrast, achieves privacy through architecture while maintaining pose estimation performance comparable to visible-spectrum applications. This is not, strictly speaking, a "free lunch" (edge processing requires local computational resources, immediate frame disposal prevents retrospective analysis if fall detection algorithms need improvement, pose-only storage limits future applications requiring facial data), but the tradeoffs prove acceptable for safety monitoring applications where privacy concerns otherwise prevent adoption.

The broader implication—if one may gesture toward significance beyond this specific case study—is that Cavoukian's Privacy by Design framework, which dates to 2010 and which this author suspects reviewers will note is "somewhat dated" despite remaining conceptually relevant, can inform healthcare AI architecture in developing country contexts where data protection regulations provide limited enforcement. When GDPR and HIPAA don't apply (Cambodia not being subject to European or U.S. healthcare privacy laws, though one imagines that stating the obvious is required for international audiences), privacy protection must emerge from system design rather than regulatory compliance. Edge architecture with pose-only storage demonstrates technical pathway for governance-driven design that doesn't rely on external enforcement mechanisms—the architecture is the governance, in a sense that sounds grandiose but which captures the structural difference from policy-based approaches.

### 5.1.2 Accessibility Governance Through Cost Optimization

Edge architecture yields what we characterized in Methodology Section 3.1.1 as "economic co-benefits" beyond privacy protection, though whether these constitute secondary effects or co-equal design goals depends on one's narrative framing (this paper emphasizes privacy as primary driver for reasons related to conference theme alignment, but cost-effectiveness arguably motivated the architectural choice equally). Eliminating cloud infrastructure reduces 3-year total cost by 61% ($672 vs. $1,719), expanding market accessibility from cloud-dependent alternatives in ways that matter for health equity.

The zero-subscription model removes recurring payment barriers that prove particularly challenging for middle-income Cambodian households earning $870-$1,622/month where a $45/month subscription represents 2.8-5.2% of monthly income indefinitely. The distinction between one-time purchases and ongoing subscriptions matters more than absolute cost comparisons might suggest—a point that behavioral economics research has established thoroughly, though this paper refrains from extensive literature review on temporal discounting and mental accounting in favor of maintaining focus on technology governance (one must resist the temptation to demonstrate familiarity with adjacent literature at the expense of coherent argumentation, a temptation to which academic writing frequently succumbs).

The estimated market reach of 216,000-324,000 elderly individuals (12-18% of Cambodia's projected 2030 elderly population) represents meaningful expansion beyond high-income early adopters who can afford subscription-based cloud monitoring. Whether 12-18% constitutes "successful" accessibility depends on comparison points: if 5% represents current monitoring technology adoption among Cambodian elderly (a figure this author cannot verify but which seems plausible given limited assistive technology penetration in middle-income developing countries), then expanding to 12-18% would represent 2.4-3.6× increase in reach. If, alternatively, "successful accessibility" means reaching majority of elderly population (50%+), then 12-18% falls far short and represents incremental improvement rather than transformative change.

The framing matters for governance implications: edge-based architecture expands accessibility beyond cloud alternatives, but substantial portions of elderly population remain unreached. Low-income and rural populations require alternative deployment models—potentially subsidized programs, community-based installations, or policy interventions beyond individual household purchases. Technology design alone cannot solve health equity challenges rooted in economic inequality; it can, however, avoid exacerbating inequality through pricing structures that systematically exclude middle- and low-income populations. The zero-subscription edge model represents harm reduction—eliminating recurring payment barriers—rather than universal accessibility, a distinction that might disappoint those seeking technological solutions to eliminate health disparities but which reflects realistic assessment of what system architecture can and cannot achieve.

### 5.1.3 Context-Specific Design for Developing Countries

The system design incorporates regional epidemiological evidence in ways that warrant acknowledgment as governance-relevant design practice, even if "incorporating regional evidence" sounds like standard engineering rather than governance innovation. Three incident types—falls while standing/walking, falls from bed/chair, and abnormal sit-to-stand transitions—were prioritized based on Thai elderly fall data (37.7% of home accidents are falls, per Maiyapakdee et al. 2025) and Chinese long-term care studies (bed/chair falls explicitly documented as significant adverse events by Li & Shi 2022). This evidence-based incident prioritization contrasts with technology-driven approaches that detect whatever algorithms can most easily classify rather than what epidemiology identifies as highest-priority safety concerns.

Hardware selection (850nm NIR cameras, edge processor) addresses Cambodia's middle-income market constraints while maintaining technical performance requirements—a balance that proves difficult to achieve when developing-country applications adapt technologies designed for high-income markets. The Hikvision DS-2CD1343G2-IUF cameras at $63 each represent approximately one-tenth the cost of research-grade RGB-D sensors frequently employed in fall detection studies, a price differential that fundamentally alters market accessibility. Whether affordable cameras sacrifice critical capabilities depends on application requirements: for pose-based fall detection, NIR cameras provide adequate skeleton visibility (91.3% keypoint detection validates this assumption); for applications requiring precise depth measurement or facial recognition, affordable cameras would prove insufficient. Matching hardware capabilities to application needs rather than maximizing technical specifications represents engineering judgment, but when that judgment explicitly considers affordability barriers in target deployment context, it becomes governance-informed design.

This demonstrates—or at minimum illustrates, if "demonstrates" claims too much—a governance-driven approach for resource-constrained contexts where off-the-shelf solutions developed for high-income markets prove economically inaccessible. The approach is not revolutionary (selecting appropriate hardware for deployment context hardly constitutes innovation), but it represents different design priorities than technology-first development that optimizes performance metrics without considering cost constraints as governance dimensions worthy of equal design attention.

## 5.2 Technical Validation Contributions

### 5.2.1 NIR Camera Compatibility for Privacy-Preserving Monitoring

The validation of MediaPipe pose estimation on 850nm NIR footage (91.3% keypoint detection across 20 diverse commercial CCTV videos) fills a gap in the literature that one might characterize as either "significant" or "narrow" depending on disciplinary perspective. Computer vision researchers might consider NIR validation a straightforward extension of existing pose estimation capabilities, hardly worthy of extended discussion. Healthcare AI researchers and practitioners considering elderly monitoring deployments might find the validation critical: it establishes that affordable security cameras can support pose-based fall detection, obviating need for expensive visible-light or depth sensors while maintaining privacy benefits.

The literature on pose estimation performance across imaging modalities is, to put it generously, incomplete. Wang et al. (2020)'s survey of elderly fall detection systems catalogs extensive work on RGB cameras, depth sensors, and wearable devices, but NIR-specific validation receives limited attention—not because researchers doubt NIR compatibility, but because the specific question of "do pose estimation algorithms trained on visible-spectrum data maintain performance on 850nm infrared imagery from affordable CCTV cameras?" sits at intersection of multiple research domains (computer vision, healthcare AI, assistive technology) in ways that none fully owns. This study addresses that intersection, providing empirical evidence that yes, pose estimation works on NIR footage, with performance characteristics (91.3% detection, 0.868 confidence, 12.3% false negatives) that enable 24/7 elderly monitoring without facial recognition technology.

The practical contribution—if one may frame research findings in terms of practitioner utility without offending academic sensibilities that prioritize theoretical advance—is deployment guidance for privacy-preserving monitoring systems: affordable NIR cameras prove viable for pose-based applications, though practitioners should validate camera-specific performance given the 73.8-98.9% detection range observed across the 20 test videos. Environmental factors matter (indoor scenarios outperformed outdoor by 5.9 percentage points), camera placement affects results (persons occupying small frame portions at distance >10m degraded performance), and manufacturer differences exist (though whether dome vs. turret vs. bullet camera types show genuine performance variation or sampling noise remains unclear given n=5-8 per type).

### 5.2.2 Pipeline Trade-off Analysis for Safety-Critical Systems

The comparison of baseline MediaPipe-only versus integrated YOLO+MediaPipe approaches revealed accuracy-speed tradeoffs that inform deployment decisions for safety-critical applications: integrated approach achieved 5.7% higher keypoint detection and 22.2% better pose coverage, but processed 2.3× slower than baseline (20.53 FPS vs. 47.37 FPS). This is not, strictly speaking, a novel finding—adding person detection stages to pose estimation pipelines obviously increases accuracy while reducing speed, a tradeoff documented in computer vision literature with perhaps tedious thoroughness. The contribution, such as it is, lies in quantifying the tradeoff for NIR camera deployment specifically and providing decision rationale for safety-critical prioritization.

The decision to select integrated pipeline despite 2.3× speed penalty reflects governance principle, in a sense: when safety-critical applications face accuracy-speed tradeoffs and both configurations exceed minimum performance requirements (both >15 FPS real-time threshold), prioritizing reliability over efficiency embodies different values than commercial applications optimizing for computational cost reduction. This may sound like obvious engineering judgment—of course safety-critical systems should prioritize accuracy—but deployment decisions frequently privilege speed and cost over reliability when immediate consequences of failure remain invisible. Falls not detected don't generate error messages; they generate injury and mortality that might be attributed to "natural causes" rather than system failure.

The broader question of how to make design tradeoff decisions for safety-critical AI systems deserves more attention than this paper can provide within its already-strained page budget. When do accuracy improvements justify speed penalties? How much performance margin constitutes "sufficient" for deployment? What false negative rates prove acceptable when failures cause harm? These questions lack algorithmic answers; they require value judgments about acceptable risk that governance frameworks discuss in abstract terms but that system designers must operationalize through specific configuration choices. This paper documents one such choice—accuracy over speed for elderly fall detection—as case study in governance-informed technical decision-making, though whether selecting the more accurate of two functional pipelines constitutes meaningful "governance" or merely competent engineering remains debatable.

## 5.3 Limitations

This study is subject to several limitations that shape appropriate interpretation of findings and delimit claims about system capabilities. The limitations deserve explicit acknowledgment not merely as methodological courtesy but as substantive constraints that inform what conclusions can and cannot be drawn from the validation results.

### 5.3.1 Validation Scope

**What was validated**: NIR camera compatibility (pose estimation performance on 850nm infrared footage) and cost-effectiveness (edge vs. cloud system expense comparison over 3 years). The validation establishes that affordable NIR cameras can support pose-based monitoring and that edge architecture reduces costs substantially compared to subscription-based cloud alternatives.

**What was not validated**: Fall detection accuracy, incident classification performance, real-world deployment reliability, user acceptance, coverage adequacy, or long-term system maintenance requirements. The gap between "pose estimation works on NIR cameras" and "the system accurately detects falls in elderly homes" spans multiple validation dimensions that this preliminary study does not address.

The limited scope reflects resource constraints and strategic focus on highest-uncertainty technical assumption (NIR compatibility) rather than comprehensive system validation. Fall detection algorithms exist in abundance—Wang et al. (2020) surveys them with perhaps exhaustive completeness—but whether these algorithms work with affordable NIR cameras rather than expensive visible-light or depth sensors remained less thoroughly documented. Validating the component most specific to the governance-driven design's hardware choices (affordable privacy-preserving cameras) takes priority over validating components where existing literature provides adequate guidance (pose-based fall detection approaches).

This validation strategy has both pragmatic and principled justifications: pragmatically, limited resources necessitate targeted validation of critical uncertainties rather than attempting comprehensive evaluation with inadequate rigor; in principle, establishing technical feasibility of privacy-first architecture enables subsequent work on fall detection accuracy, deployment studies, and user acceptance research that would prove premature if NIR compatibility remained unvalidated. Whether this constitutes appropriate scoping or inadequate validation depends on one's perspective regarding how much evidence suffices to claim system "feasibility"—skeptics might argue (not unreasonably) that validating pose detection without validating fall detection leaves the most critical question unanswered.

### 5.3.2 Testing Environment

MediaPipe pose estimation was tested on commercial CCTV demonstration footage, not on elderly subjects in residential environments. This introduces multiple limitations:

**Population differences**: Commercial demo videos show general adult populations rather than elderly individuals with age-specific movement patterns, body proportions, gait characteristics, and mobility impairments. Elderly individuals move differently than younger adults—slower gait speeds, altered posture, reduced joint range of motion, use of mobility aids—in ways that might affect pose estimation performance. Whether 91.3% keypoint detection on general populations generalizes to elderly subjects remains empirically unverified.

**Activity differences**: Demo videos feature normal daily activities (walking, standing, sitting) rather than fall incidents or abnormal movements that fall detection must recognize. Pose estimation performance on controlled movements may not predict performance during dynamic fall events where limb positions change rapidly and bodies adopt unusual configurations. Falls happen fast—literally, gravitational acceleration being what it is—and whether pose estimation maintains 91.3% detection during rapid uncontrolled movements requires validation on fall-specific datasets.

**Environmental differences**: Commercial CCTV footage comes from business environments (stores, offices, parking lots) rather than residential homes where elderly monitoring would deploy. Home environments differ in lighting conditions, camera angles (ceiling-mounted vs. wall-mounted), room layouts, furniture interference with sight lines, and background clutter that might affect pose detection. Whether the 91.3% average performance holds in actual Cambodian middle-income homes—with specific architectural features, furniture arrangements, and ambient lighting characteristic of target deployment context—requires in-situ validation.

### 5.3.3 Hardware Deployment

Processing speed measurements (20.53 FPS integrated pipeline, 47.37 FPS baseline) were collected on standard hardware, not on the target NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano 8GB edge processor. This creates uncertainty about actual deployment performance: will Jetson achieve similar speeds, or will hardware-specific optimizations (or limitations) alter throughput?

NVIDIA's Jetson Orin Nano specifications suggest adequate processing capability—8GB RAM, GPU with 1024 CUDA cores, 32 Tensor cores for AI inference—but specifications and real-world performance diverge with frustrating regularity in edge AI deployment. Thermal throttling under sustained load, memory bandwidth limitations for multi-camera processing, and software optimization requirements for Jetson-specific architecture might reduce FPS below standard hardware results. Alternatively, Jetson's specialized AI accelerators might improve performance through hardware-level optimizations not available on consumer GPUs.

The uncertainty about Jetson performance matters because multi-camera processing (4 simultaneous video streams for 360° coverage) quadruples computational demands. If 20.53 FPS represents single-camera throughput, 4-camera deployment might require parallel processing or sequential frame handling that reduces effective per-camera frame rates. Whether Jetson Orin Nano handles 4× parallel processing at 20.53 FPS each, or whether compromises emerge (reduced resolution, lower frame rates, sequential instead of parallel processing), requires hardware-specific validation before claiming deployment feasibility.

### 5.3.4 Market Accessibility

The cost-effectiveness analysis estimates 216,000-324,000 potential users (12-18% of elderly population) based on household income data and affordability assumptions, but this represents market reach rather than actual adoption. Multiple factors beyond cost determine technology adoption:

**Perceived need**: Do households recognize fall risk as serious enough to warrant monitoring investment? Fall perception varies—some families view falls as inevitable aging consequence not requiring technological intervention, others recognize falls as preventable injuries deserving protection measures.

**Technology trust**: Do potential users trust that the system will work reliably and respect privacy commitments? Trust in AI systems remains contested, particularly for health applications involving continuous monitoring. Even with pose-only storage and zero facial recognition, some elderly individuals and families may reject monitoring as surveillance.

**Family dynamics**: Who makes elderly care technology decisions—the elderly individual, adult children, extended family consensus? Decision-making processes vary across households in ways that affect adoption regardless of affordability.

**Alternative options**: How does AI monitoring compare to alternatives like hiring caregivers, modifying home environment (grab bars, non-slip flooring), arranging for family member to live with elderly individual, or moving elderly to institutional care? Technology adoption depends on comparative evaluation with non-technical alternatives.

The 216,000-324,000 estimate establishes economic feasibility (this many households have financial capacity to purchase the system) but not adoption likelihood (this many households will actually purchase). Actual adoption rates might prove substantially lower if non-economic barriers dominate, or potentially higher if technology trust and perceived need exceed our conservative assumptions.

### 5.3.5 Generalizability

This study focuses on Cambodia as case study for middle-income developing country context, but findings may not generalize to other regional contexts with different household structures, income distributions, cultural norms regarding elderly care, or privacy expectations. Cambodia's specific characteristics—strong family caregiving traditions, preference for home-based care, middle-income urban household income ranges, limited data protection regulation—shape both problem definition and solution constraints in ways that might not apply elsewhere.

Southeast Asian countries (Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Philippines) share some characteristics with Cambodia but differ in urbanization rates, income distributions, and technology adoption patterns. South Asian countries (India, Bangladesh, Pakistan) face similar economic constraints but different cultural contexts. Sub-Saharan African countries deal with distinct elderly care traditions and healthcare infrastructure. The governance-driven design approach—starting with privacy principles and regional evidence—might transfer across contexts, but specific architectural choices (camera selection, cost optimization targets, incident type prioritization) require context-specific adaptation rather than direct replication.

## 5.4 Future Directions

This preliminary study raises multiple questions requiring future investigation, organized here by validation dimension rather than chronological priority (which would require resource allocation decisions beyond this paper's scope).

### 5.4.1 Benchmark Dataset Validation

Fall detection accuracy requires validation on standard benchmark datasets with ground truth annotations: MCF (Multiple Cameras Fall), LE2I (Le2i Fall Detection Dataset), UP-Fall (University of Rzeszów Fall Detection Dataset) represent frequently-cited options, though dataset selection involves tradeoffs (annotation quality, incident diversity, environmental realism) that merit careful consideration. Benchmark validation would establish whether pose-based incident detection achieves acceptable accuracy-precision-recall tradeoffs for deployment, providing the fall detection performance evidence that NIR compatibility validation deliberately scoped out.

### 5.4.2 Custom Dataset Collection

Western benchmark datasets may not adequately represent Southeast Asian elderly populations in ways that matter for fall detection algorithm development. The author proposes (with awareness that proposing without funding constitutes aspirational planning) collecting a CamTech dataset: 180 videos featuring age-appropriate actors simulating the three priority incident types (falls while standing/walking, falls from bed/chair, abnormal sit-to-stand transitions) across three lighting conditions (daylight, evening, nighttime NIR). This would address Western dataset bias while enabling lighting-condition-specific algorithm optimization.

### 5.4.3 Hardware Validation

Deploying the complete pipeline on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano and measuring actual processing speeds for 4-camera configurations would validate (or refute) the deployment feasibility claims based on standard hardware testing. Hardware validation should include sustained-operation testing (hours to days of continuous processing) to identify thermal throttling, memory leaks, or reliability issues that short-duration testing misses.

### 5.4.4 Expanded Detection Capabilities

The current system targets three incident types based on regional epidemiological evidence, but elderly safety encompasses additional scenarios warranting detection: prolonged floor lying (failure to rise after fall), bathroom incidents (where privacy concerns intensify), wandering behavior (for dementia patients), and abnormal inactivity patterns (potential indicators of health deterioration). Expanding detection capabilities requires additional algorithm development and validation, balanced against complexity creep that undermines deployment feasibility.

### 5.4.5 Policy Framework Development

The technical system enables privacy-preserving monitoring, but broader policy questions remain: What informed consent processes suit elderly monitoring (particularly for cognitively impaired individuals)? Who controls monitoring data and alert settings? What responsibilities do family members assume when deploying monitoring systems? How should healthcare providers integrate home monitoring data into care coordination? These questions exceed technical system scope but prove essential for responsible deployment. Developing governance guidelines for healthcare AI in developing countries—informed by but not limited to this case study—represents important future work that this author lacks expertise to pursue independently but hopes might attract interdisciplinary collaboration.

### 5.4.6 Longitudinal Adoption Studies

Understanding actual adoption patterns, sustained usage rates, user acceptance evolution, and long-term value proposition requires longitudinal studies following households over months to years. Do families continue using monitoring systems after initial novelty fades? Do elderly users adapt to monitoring presence or maintain discomfort? What technical failures occur during extended deployment, and how do households respond to maintenance requirements? These questions require partnership with local communities, sustained research funding, and longitudinal commitment that preliminary feasibility studies cannot provide but which prove essential for translating technical demonstrations into deployed systems that actually improve elderly safety.
