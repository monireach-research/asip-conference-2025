# Section 1: Introduction

## Problem Context

Since 2000s, the global demographic transitions has been constituting a pressing challenge for healthcare systems. Southeast Asia's elderly population is projected to increase from 12.2% in 2024 to 22.9% by 2050 (WHO SEARO, n.d.). Falls, in particular, represent the leading cause of injury-related deaths among elderly populations (684,000 annual fatalities globally), with 60% concentrated in Western Pacific and Southeast Asian regions (WHO, 2021). Cambodia's elderly population will reach approximately 1.8 million by 2030 (National Institute of Statistics, 2019).

Like other Southeast-asian-region families, these are primarily middle income urban households that, due to strong family caregiving norms, prefer home-based elderly care over institutional facilities. This creates the cultural or regional requirement that technology solutions must fit within family homes, shaping both the problem space and the solution constraints in ways that Western healthcare AI research does not always adequately consider.

## Technology Governance Challenges

Existing elderly safety monitoring technologies present what might charitably be characterized as "critical governance challenges", fundamental design choices consisting of privacy risks that governance frameworks nowadays have been discussing extensively.

Two main barriers from the privacy risks deserve particular attention: Privacy concerns and accessibility constraints.

### Privacy Governance Challenges

Cloud-based AI systems transmit sensitive health data, such as video footage of individuals in private home environments, their behavioral patterns, movement trajectories, and other digital exhaust that continuous monitoring generates to third-party servers for processing and storage. This creates financial recognition risks, behavioral profiling capabilities, and re-identification vulnerabilities that affect elderly populations, who may not fully understand the surveillance implications of "safety monitoring" technologies (Burns, 2024; Birkstedt et al., 2023).

### Accessibility Governance Challenges

In a long term, recurring monthly subscription fees associated with cloud-based systems prove more consequential than the initial hardware investment. The Kami Fall Detect Camera, a commercial example that clearly provides public pricing information, charges a minimum of $45 monthly (or $540 annually) in addition to the initial hardware cost (Upadhyay, 2025). For middle-income Cambodian households earning $870-$1,622 monthly (4th to 5th income quintiles) according to Cambodia Socio-Economic Survey data (National Institute of Statistics, 2019). This subscription represents indefinite 2.8-5.2% of their monthly income, which transforms a technology purchase into an ongoing financial obligation that competes with food, utilities, healthcare, education, and all other household expenses.

This economy constraint undermines digital inclusion objectives, a problem deserving more attention in technology-focused forums, where, conversely, technical innovations (such as state-of-the-art algorithmic development) are emphasized over actual societal needs.

Sylla et al. (2025) document persistent economic and infrastructure barriers to technology adoption in low and middle-income countries, while Richardson et al. (2022), within their Digital Determinant of Health frameworks, frame cost structures as a factor that excludes populations from healthcare technology benefits.

This paper will sidestep the debate of whether framing cost as a dimension of governance is a valid conceptualization or an overly broad application of the term, as some might argue that economics and governance are separate, or whether systematic economic exclusion from healthcare technologies represents governance failure.

### Governance Fragmentation
