# Section 1: Introduction

## 1.1 Problem Context

The notion that global demographic transitions constitute a pressing challenge for healthcare systems is not exactly new—one might say it has been discussed extensively in policy circles for the past several decades (though "several decades" increasingly feels like an understatement when reviewing literature that treats 2000s-era projections as "recent" trends). Southeast Asia's elderly population is projected to increase from 12.2% in 2024 to 22.9% by 2050 (WHO SEARO, n.d.), a demographic shift that sounds dramatic in percentage terms but which, when one considers the absolute numbers involved, represents something approaching a fundamental restructuring of regional age distributions.

Falls, in particular, represent the leading cause of injury-related deaths among elderly populations—684,000 annual fatalities globally, with 60% concentrated in Western Pacific and Southeast Asia regions (WHO, 2021). Cambodia's elderly population will reach approximately 1.8 million by 2030 (National Institute of Statistics, 2019), though projections of this sort always carry uncertainties that demographic models treat with perhaps more confidence than circumstances warrant. These are primarily middle-income urban households, a specification that matters for reasons that will become clear when we discuss affordability thresholds in ways that might seem tediously specific but which prove critical for understanding market accessibility.

The challenge that middle-income families face—and here we encounter one of those realities that policy documents often acknowledge briefly before moving on to more technologically exciting topics—is providing continuous supervision for elderly relatives while managing employment obligations that, regrettably, do not pause to accommodate family caregiving needs. Strong family caregiving norms rooted in filial piety values create preference for home-based elderly care over institutional facilities across Southeast Asia (Romli et al., 2017), which means that technology solutions must fit within family homes rather than assuming the sort of institutional deployment contexts that much assistive technology research implicitly targets. This cultural context shapes both the problem space and the solution constraints in ways that Western healthcare AI research does not always adequately consider (a gap that this paper attempts to address, though whether one case study constitutes "addressing" a systemic research bias remains—one suspects this will become a recurring theme—debatable).

## 1.2 Technology Governance Challenges

Existing elderly safety monitoring technologies present what might charitably be characterized as "critical governance challenges" or, less charitably, as "fundamental design choices that systematically exclude the populations most needing assistance while creating privacy risks that governance frameworks discuss extensively but rarely prevent." Two barriers deserve particular attention: privacy concerns and accessibility constraints, though the framing of these as separate "barriers" somewhat obscures how they emerge from related architectural decisions.

**Privacy governance challenges**: Cloud-based AI systems transmit sensitive health data—video footage of individuals in private home environments, behavioral patterns, movement trajectories, all the digital exhaust that continuous monitoring generates—to third-party servers for processing and storage. This design choice (and it is a choice, though commercial systems often present cloud dependency as inevitable technical requirement rather than architectural decision) creates facial recognition risks, behavioral profiling capabilities, and re-identification vulnerabilities that affect elderly populations who may not fully understand the surveillance implications of "safety monitoring" technologies (Burns, 2024; Birkstedt et al., 2023). Commercial fall detection camera systems exemplify these concerns, requiring continuous cloud connectivity for fall detection processing (Upadhyay, 2025)—a requirement that conveniently generates recurring subscription revenue while creating the privacy exposures that governance frameworks caution against.

Data protection regulations exist, certainly—GDPR in Europe has become something of a touchstone in privacy governance discussions, mentioned with frequency that sometimes exceeds its actual geographic applicability. But enforcement mechanisms remain limited in Southeast Asian contexts (Burns, 2024), which means that privacy protection cannot rely on regulatory compliance but must instead emerge from system architecture itself. This brings us to Privacy by Design principles (Cavoukian, 2010), a framework that dates to—yes, 2010, making it "recent work" by the standards of academic citations despite being old enough to attend middle school—and which emphasizes embedding privacy into architecture from inception rather than retrofitting protections after deployment.

**Accessibility governance challenges**: Cloud-based systems require ongoing subscription fees that prove more consequential than initial hardware costs for long-term affordability. The Kami Fall Detect Camera, to cite a specific commercial example that conveniently provides public pricing information, charges approximately $45 monthly ($540 annually, though the exact amount varies by subscription tier and promotional periods) in addition to initial hardware costs (Upadhyay, 2025). For middle-income Cambodian households earning $870-$1,622 monthly—4th and 5th income quintiles according to Cambodia Socio-Economic Survey data (National Institute of Statistics, 2019)—this subscription represents 2.8-5.2% of monthly income, indefinitely, which transforms a technology purchase into an ongoing financial obligation that competes with food, utilities, healthcare, education, and all the other expenses that household budgets must accommodate.

This economic barrier undermines digital inclusion objectives in ways that deserve more attention than they typically receive in technology-focused venues (which tend to emphasize algorithmic innovation over accessibility analysis, a priority ordering that perhaps reflects researcher incentives more than societal needs). Sylla et al. (2025) document persistent economic and infrastructure barriers to technology adoption in low- and middle-income countries, while Richardson et al. (2022) propose Digital Determinants of Health frameworks that acknowledge how cost structures systematically exclude populations from healthcare technology benefits. Whether framing cost as "governance" dimension constitutes conceptual overreach—some might argue that economics and governance occupy separate analytical domains—or whether systematic economic exclusion from healthcare technologies represents governance failure depends on how broadly one defines governance, a definitional question this paper will mostly sidestep.

**Governance fragmentation**: AI governance frameworks remain, to employ the technical term, "nascent and fragmented" (Birkstedt et al., 2023; Burns, 2024; Sylla et al., 2025). The field has produced extensive literature on ethical principles—transparency, accountability, fairness, explainability, the list varies slightly by framework but converges on similar themes—while providing limited practical guidance for operationalizing these principles in resource-constrained healthcare contexts. Almeida et al. (2020) synthesize 21 AI governance models into unified framework, which sounds comprehensive until one attempts to extract specific implementation guidance for, say, deploying elderly monitoring systems in Cambodian middle-income households and discovers that synthesis of high-level principles does not directly translate to architectural specifications. This gap between principle and practice motivates the governance-driven design approach that this paper attempts to demonstrate, though again, whether one case study "demonstrates" broader applicability or merely "illustrates" context-specific implementation remains subject to interpretation.

## 1.3 Research Gap

Existing elderly monitoring solutions prioritize either privacy protection (federated learning, depth cameras that eliminate facial recognition capability), affordability (cloud-based systems with subscription models that minimize upfront costs), or technical performance (RGB-D sensors that provide superior accuracy at higher price points)—rarely addressing all three dimensions as integrated design objectives (Chang & Wang, 2024; Jalaleddini et al., 2014; Vaiyapuri et al., 2021). This fragmentation reflects what might be termed a fundamental gap in healthcare AI design methodology, or perhaps more accurately, reflects that privacy, cost, and performance optimization respond to different incentive structures that research and commercial development don't naturally integrate.

The literature gap operates at several levels, which this author will attempt to articulate without falling into the trap of claiming that no prior work exists (a trap into which literature reviews sometimes stumble when establishing research novelty). Cavoukian's (2010) Privacy by Design framework articulates philosophical principles—"Privacy Embedded into Design," "Proactive not Reactive," seven foundational principles that have been cited extensively—but lacks empirical validation in healthcare AI contexts showing how these principles translate to specific architectural choices. Burns (2024) identifies edge computing potential for privacy governance through data locality but does not quantify cost-effectiveness implications for developing countries where cloud infrastructure costs create accessibility barriers beyond privacy concerns. Almeida et al. (2020) examine healthcare AI ethics but focus on clinical decision-making systems rather than continuous monitoring applications for vulnerable populations in residential settings.

Furthermore—and here we encounter a gap that seems almost obvious once stated but which the literature does not adequately address—edge computing's potential for enabling privacy governance in healthcare AI remains underexplored, particularly regarding whether privacy-first architectural design yields economic co-benefits that expand market accessibility. The question is not whether edge computing can enhance privacy (the answer is straightforwardly yes, data that never leaves local devices cannot be compromised by cloud breaches), but whether edge architecture simultaneously reduces costs in ways that matter for middle-income market segments. Existing literature treats privacy and affordability as separate optimization dimensions, potentially trading off against each other, rather than examining whether architectural choices that enforce privacy might also eliminate cloud infrastructure expenses that create accessibility barriers.

Regional studies on elderly care technology adoption in Southeast Asia focus primarily on high-income urban populations (Romli et al., 2017), with limited attention to middle-income market segments that represent larger potential user bases but face affordability constraints that high-income studies do not encounter. This income-bracket gap in the literature means that technology adoption research may systematically miss the accessibility barriers most relevant for scaling deployment beyond early-adopter populations.

## 1.4 Research Objectives

This study addresses the identified gaps through three objectives that we characterize as "primary" not because secondary objectives don't exist but because focusing on these three keeps the paper's scope within manageable bounds given conference page limits and the author's remaining sanity with submission deadlines approaching:

1. **Demonstrate governance-driven architectural design**: Show how privacy governance principles can drive technical architecture decisions from inception rather than being retrofitted post-deployment, using elderly safety monitoring for Cambodia as case study. The choice of "demonstrate" over "prove" reflects appropriate epistemic humility—one case study illustrates an approach without establishing universal applicability.

2. **Validate technical feasibility of privacy-preserving edge architecture**: Empirically test whether affordable 850nm near-infrared (NIR) security cameras—selected specifically for privacy-preserving night vision capability that enables 24/7 monitoring without visible-light cameras that might feel more intrusive—maintain adequate pose estimation performance for continuous monitoring applications. This addresses the highest-uncertainty technical assumption in the proposed architecture: that pose estimation algorithms trained predominantly on visible-spectrum imagery will work on NIR footage from affordable CCTV cameras.

3. **Quantify cost-effectiveness and accessibility implications**: Compare edge-based architecture total costs against cloud-dependent alternatives to assess whether privacy-first design expands market accessibility for middle-income Cambodian households. The quantification matters because claims about "affordability" or "accessibility" without specific cost analysis and market reach estimates constitute the sort of hand-waving that governance discussions sometimes engage in when gesturing toward practical implications without actually calculating them.

This work contributes empirical evidence that privacy governance need not trade off against affordability or performance—or at minimum, contributes evidence in one specific context that might (the hedging here is deliberate) generalize to other resource-constrained healthcare AI applications. When integrated at the architectural design stage rather than applied as post-hoc compliance measure, privacy principles can guide technical decisions that simultaneously enhance data protection and expand economic accessibility. The study targets middle-income urban Cambodian households (4th-5th income quintiles, representing estimated 12-18% of elderly population by 2030, a figure that involves multiple demographic assumptions detailed in Methodology Section 3.3.2) but has broader implications for healthcare AI governance in resource-constrained contexts globally—though whether "broader implications" materialize depends on factors beyond this single paper's scope, including whether other researchers find the governance-driven design approach sufficiently compelling to adapt for their own contexts.
