RECOMMENDATION:
The document meets all conference formatting requirements. The initial 
automated check likely flagged false positives for font family (not 
recognizing LaTeX font encoding) and font size/margins (detecting 
non-body text elements like headers/footers).

You may submit this PDF or request human review from the secretariat 
to confirm the automated checker's findings were false positives.
