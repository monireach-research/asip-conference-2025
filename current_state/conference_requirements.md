## Submission Strategy (Revised Oct 26, 2025)

### Privacy Governance Focus

Position our research as a **governance-driven AI application design case study**:

1. **Privacy governance drives technical architecture**
   - Edge computing eliminates cloud data transmission risks
   - Pose-only storage prevents facial recognition/re-identification
   - Immediate frame disposal minimizes data collection by design
   - 100% on-device processing ensures data locality

2. **Governance principles embedded from inception**
   - Privacy requirements shaped all technical choices
   - Architecture designed for compliance with data protection principles
   - Transparent incident detection criteria (explainability)

3. **Co-benefits of privacy-first design**
   - Cost reduction ($540 vs $1,350-$1,950/year) emerges from edge architecture
   - Offline operation suitable for developing country infrastructure
   - User consent framework for camera monitoring

4. **Regional context**
   - Healthcare AI for vulnerable populations in developing countries
   - Cambodia as case study for privacy-preserving healthcare innovation
   - Scalable model for similar contexts

---

## Target Audience

- AI ethics researchers
- Technology policy makers
- Healthcare innovation specialists
- Digital inclusion advocates
- Smart city planners
- Academic researchers in emerging technologies

---

## Notes

- Conference emphasizes **interdisciplinary approaches** to technology governance
- Strong focus on **practical applications** and **policy implications**
- Regional context (Cambodia, Southeast Asia) is a plus
- Innovation combined with social impact is valued
