## 4. Sample Abstract

**Purpose** – The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between mindfulness and work engagement, with a particular focus on exploring the extent to which four facets of mindfulness, i.e., "attention", "awareness", "present focus" and "acceptance" impact on work engagement.

**Design/methodology/approach** – Exploratory factor and multiple regression analyses were used to test the hypothesized relationships among a sample of 130 employees.

**Findings** – The findings show that mindfulness as a single construct is positively related to work engagement. The analysis from the facet level of mindfulness illustrates that each of four facets is also significantly related to work engagement. Employees with refined attentional skills and accepting the present moment reality were found to contribute more to work engagement.

**Practical implications** – Organizational programs that focus on building personal resources could use the meditation-based mindfulness programs to help individuals widen their attention span as well as to develop a non-judgmental attitude.

**Originality/value** – Focusing on developing mindful employees and promoting mindfulness practices at workplace, especially, by working on specific strategies, to expand "attentional skills" and the "attitude of accepting the present moment reality" may be another promising strategy to enhance work engagement.

**Keywords**: Work engagement, Acceptance, Attitudes, Mindfulness, Attention, Present focus.
